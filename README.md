## Test Locally

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher)
- **npm**
- **MySQL**
- **Docker:** installed on your system
- **Docker Compose:** installed on your system

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository on your local machine.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:KaungZayY/FamSnapNodeApi.git
```
`cd` into cloned repository.
```bash
cd FamSnapNodeApi
```

### Step 2: Environmental Variable Setup
Copy the `.env.example` file as `.env`
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Setup the env variables in `.env`.

### Step 3: NPM install
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Git Check to `DockerizedVersion` branch
```bash
git checkout DockerizedVersion
```
### Step 5: Add Nacessary Repositories

At the root of your project directory, create a new folder named public.

```bash
mkdir public
```

Inside the `public` folder, create `images` sub-folder to store images.

```bash
cd images
```
```bash
mkdir images
```

Your project directory structure should now look like this:

```
FamSnapNodeApi/
â”œâ”€â”€ database/
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”œâ”€â”€ v1/
â””â”€â”€ (other project files and folders)
```

### Step 6: Build the Docker Image

Build the docker image by using the following bash command.

```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Step 7: Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container in the detach mode.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 8: Import the database

Go to `http://localhost:8081/` to access phpmyadmin pannel and import the database `/database/fam_snap.sql`.

### Step 9: Change MySQL Auth Mode (If necessary)
```bash
docker-compose exec db mysql -u root -p
```
```bash
ALTER USER 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '123';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Restart docker-compose
```bash
docker-compose restart
```
